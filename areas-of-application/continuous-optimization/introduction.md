# Continuous optimization

Continuous optimization problems arise throughout science and industry. On their face, continuous optimization problems rarely seem quantum mechanical; nevertheless, quantum algorithms have been proposed for accelerating both [convex](../../areas-of-application/continuous-optimization/general-convex-optimization.md#general-convex-optimization) and [nonconvex](../../areas-of-application/continuous-optimization/nonconvex-optimization-escaping-saddle-points-and-finding-local-minima.md#nonconvex-optimization-escaping-saddle-points-and-finding-local-minima) continuous optimization. Most of the research on these algorithms thus far has been to develop and utilize the diverse set of primitive ingredients that give rise to potential quantum advantage in this space, without an eye toward the end-to-end practicality of the algorithms. Developing a better understanding of the practicality of these approaches should be a focus of future work.
