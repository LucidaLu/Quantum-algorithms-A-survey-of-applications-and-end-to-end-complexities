# Nuclear and particle physics

 Simulating nuclear and particle physics appears an inherently quantum problem. There have been proposals to use quantum computers to accelerate simulations of quantum field theories, nuclear structure, neutrino physics, and quantum gravity [@davoudi2022quantumHEP]. In this section, we will focus on the simulation of quantum field theories and nuclear structure, as these have received the most attention in the literature to date and are the closest to having end-to-end fault-tolerant resource estimates available. The building blocks of quantum algorithms for data analysis in high energy physics [@delgado2022HEPdataanalysis] can be found in the sections on [variational quantum algorithms](../../quantum-algorithmic-primitives/variational-quantum-algorithms.md#variational-quantum-algorithms) and [machine learning](../../areas-of-application/machine-learning-with-classical-data/introduction.md#machine-learning-with-classical-data). For existing reviews of quantum computing for nuclear and particle physics, we direct the reader to [@preskill2018SimQFT; @Banuls2020SimulatingLatticeGaugeTheoryReviewEurophys; @davoudi2022quantumHEP; @funcke2023LatticeReview].
