# Amplitude amplification and estimation

Quantum amplitude amplification and estimation provide means to boost or extract the amplitude of a marked quantum state that is produced in superposition with orthogonal state(s) by a unitary matrix. They are among the most widely used quantum primitives, providing quadratic speedups over classical algorithms in many settings.
